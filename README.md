# Singapore-Resale-Flat-Prices-Predicting
The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model and deploy it as a user-friendly web application that predicts the resale prices of flats in Singapore. This predictive model will be based on historical data of resale flat transactions, and it aims to assist both potential buyers and sellers in estimating the resale value of a flat.


## Pre-Requisite
1) Python: Install Python

## Installation
1) Clone the repo, create and activate the environment for the project.
2) Install all required packages from requirements.txt file using command: "pip install -r requirements.txt"

## Usage
1) Run the notebook "industrial_copper_modelling.ipynb" cells.
2) To start the app, run command: "streamlit run prediction_resale.py".
3) For flat resale price prediction, in the "Predict Selling Price" page, input the required features and click on "Predict Selling Price" button.

## Features
1) Setting up Streamlit App: Creating a user-friendly UI using Streamlit for predicting lead status and selling price.
2) Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Ensuring data quality and preparing it for analysis and model building.
3) Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing data to improve model performance.
4) Model Building and Evaluation: Developing machine learning models to predict optimal re-selling price, and evaluating their performance.
5) Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance by fine-tuning model parameters for better predictions.
